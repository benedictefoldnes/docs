## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
 
<Accordion title="How do I activate parts of a floor plan?">
  When digitizing the original floor plan, the entire drawing will be digitized. You will then have the opportunity to create zones in the editing tool after the digitization (see [create zones](/pages/engine/areas/create-zone)).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I want to download parts of the drawing. How do I do that?">
  You can do this under PDF export (see [zone view](/pages/engine/export/export-pdf#zone-view)).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I have received a room plan from a tenant, can I upload it directly to Arealize?">
  No, you must transfer this information to our form in the dashboard (see [create tenant](/pages/dashboard/specification/create-tenant)).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The room plan form is incomplete compared to what I received from the tenant.">
  Information that cannot be transferred to the room list can be written as text in the comment field.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I want to upload an updated version of the floor plan for a floor I have activated earlier. Is this possible?"> 
This is possible (See: [How to replace data basis for a floor](/pages/dashboard/activation/replace-data-basis)). 
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What gives the best result between DWG and PDF?">
  Both file formats will give almost equivalent results. PDF will in most cases be digitised faster due to varying structure of DWG files. PDF must contain scale for optimal results. 
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I only upload floor plans for offices?">
We can digitise all types of commercial premises, but if you are going to activate suggestions, our model is trained for furnishing office spaces.
